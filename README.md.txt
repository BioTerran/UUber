# UUber

An Uber-like software tool that allows users to:
- Reserve an Uber Car
- Record a ride with an Uber Car
- Favorite an Uber Car
- Record feedback for an Uber Car
- Rate Feedback
- Mark a User as Trusted
- Browse Uber Cars
- Find useful feedback for an Uber Driver

- Manage your Uber Cars
- Adjust time availabilities

		System.out.println("        Welcome UUber User     ");
		System.out.println("1. Reserve an Uber Car:");
		System.out.println("2. Record ride with Uber Car:");
		System.out.println("3. Favorite Uber Car:");
		System.out.println("4. Record feedback for Uber Car:");
		System.out.println("5. Rate feedback:");
		System.out.println("6. Mark User as Trusted");
		System.out.println("7. Browse Uber Cars:");
		System.out.println("8. Find useful feedback for Uber Driver:");
		System.out.println("9. Statistics");
		System.out.println("10. Degrees Of Separation");
		
The software is setup to connect to a MySQL database.
